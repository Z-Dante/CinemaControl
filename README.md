The most functional, but not the most polished skin. Often lazy to make conditions for small window size, to hide elements correctly, maybe not perfect alignment, there may be some garbage in the code, the skin works correctly only when forced to select a touch screen skin. Suggestions/amendments are welcome.

Features ( Without invoking sub-menus), everything at your fingertips:
+Use large icons and font for readability and easy clickability
+Display System load
+Output frame count (rendered and actual output frames)
+Switching between subtitle positions
+Playback speed Acceleration/deceleration
+Change subtitle font size and margin
+Movie Mode hides the time bar. If you ask me, the time bar makes it hard to immerse yourself in the movie, you can't get lost in it when you know when the movie is over, it makes it less abrupt. There is no default seek bar either in movies or on TV. There is a transition/exit button at the bottom (large) and at the top (small) that looks like a frame icon
+Fast recall of subtitle settings to adjust transparency, in general
+Select audio track and subtitles
+Easy Access to avisynth scripts
+"Unsaved" (favorite) files
+Change saturation
+Change transparency of the player window
+Screenshot to clipboard/file (left/right mouse button)
+Subtitle Browser
+Changing System Master Volume!
